  description: Digital-first agency where my project was to work on the CNN API/Datacloud project.
  summary: Brought in to work on the CNN Datacloud, which powers John King's Magic Wall, a multi-touch interface for displaying real-time and historical election results and various data of a geospatial nature that changes over time, as well as the CNN election center website.
  highlights:
  - Brought the Datacloud from POC to a production ready release which included the development of new extract transform load pipelines in Airflow and Neo4j to implement new features such as FEC financial summaries for election candidates and election tracking poll data split over 20+ dimensions. Additionally, I customized an ORM-like object graph mapper framework based on Neomodel to add new capabilities such as building it's own detailed markdown documentation from metadata attached to each model, it's properties, and relationships.
  - Architected and developed an ASGI geospatial-temporal data microservice with interactive documentation and playground in python, postGIS, GeoAlchemy, Starlette, Fast-API, and swagger enabling high performance point-in-polygon queries to be easily described in json as an array of filter objects to be parsed into an AST with arbitrary boolean expressions.  This capability was critical to generating heat-maps of US election campaign donations by state, county, and congressional district as well as answering the question "Given a geo-coordinate and date, who were my representatives at the local, state, and federal level.
  - Spearheaded an internal tech-leadership project that taught and mentored python engineers of all experience levels across multiple continents.
  - Architected and developed a declarative automation-testing framework in pytest and selenium that dynamically detected the angular front-end components and built all test cases dynamically in order to reduce repetition in the codebase and adapt to front-end changes automatically that would otherwise break numerous scattered tests.  Among the many benefits were reducing the automation testing codebase to 1/10th it's size, improving developer productivity by many orders of magnitude, and reducing the number of regressions per month by over 60%.

  location: Brooklyn, NY
  description: Pre-Seed, health-tech startup building a transparent marketplace for behavior health telemedicine.
  summary: See-Thru Healthcare was a small (5 person, 2 dev), seed-funded, health-tech startup whose main product was a transparent marketplace with a multi-faceted search engine for discovering and booking appointments with behavior-health telemedicine providers.
  highlights:
  - Lead the architecture and development efforts for a new group tele-therapy platform to attract thousands of new providers and patients to our main product, the marketplace.
  - Drove key architectural decisions to maximize the productivity of a small development team such as integrating with zoom for our real-time video platform, the selection of GraphQL for our API and design of the GraphQL schema, and hosting the database and backend on AWS lambda by using Zappa to wrap Flask & Graphene.
  - Architected and implemented a unified identity provider using AWS Cognito, enabling a seamless user registration and login experience across products while directing growth to the core product.
  - Designed and implemented a GraphQL & Relay API using python and graphene that drove the development of more modular, declarative, and reusable componentry in the front-end react application.

  description: Pre-ICO telecommunications dapp in stealth-mode
  summary: Co-founded a Pre-ICO start-up to research, fund, and develop a privacy-focused, decentralized communications and messaging app similar to Signal but unblockable by firewalls and not reliant on centralized hosting infrastructure and governance.
  highlights:
  - Performed extensive research in decentralized architecture, the ICO funding process, encryption, smart-contracts, decentralized identity and key recovery, etc.
  - Collaboratively architected a decentralized protocol and implementation spec using ethereum, solidity, python, and javascript.
  - Leveraged dark-routing capabilities of Postal Service over Swarm (PSS) to prevent passive traffic analysis from being able to identify who is talking to who.
  - Designed a decentralized services marketplace to allow discovery of services and incentivize the development of new services to build community and support the underlying token economy.  Standard services included multi-node media relaying to prevent IP discovery and secure receipt and retrieval of incoming messages when offline.
