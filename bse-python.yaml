  description: Digital-first agency where my project was to work on the CNN API/Datacloud project.
  summary: Brought in to work on the CNN Datacloud, which powers John King's Magic Wall, a multi-touch interface for displaying real-time and historical election results and various data of a geospatial nature that changes over time, as well as the CNN election center website.
  highlights:
  - Brought the Datacloud from POC to a production ready release which included the development of new extract transform load pipelines in Airflow and Neo4j to implement new features such as FEC financial summaries for election candidates and election tracking poll data split over 20+ dimensions
  - Customized an ORM-like object graph mapper framework based on Neomodel to add new capabilities such as building it's own detailed markdown documentation from metadata attached to each model, it's properties, and relationships.
  - Architected and developed a geospatial-temporal data microservice used for generating heat-maps of US election campaign donations and lookup representatives given geo-coordinates and a date.
  - Spearheaded an internal tech-leadership project that taught and mentored python engineers of all experience levels across multiple continents.
  # - Architected and developed a declarative automation-testing framework in pytest and selenium that reduced the testing codebase by 90%, improved developer productivity by an order of magnitude, and reduced the number of regressions per month by over 60%.  This framework dynamically detected the front-end angular components and built all test cases dynamically in order to reduce repetition in the codebase and adapt automatically to front-end changes that would otherwise break numerous scattered tests.
